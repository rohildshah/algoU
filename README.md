# AlgoU

## Introduction
AlgoU is a web app which teaches algorithms to its users via visualizations, creating a gamified experience. AlgoU is currently a POC and offers implementations of common sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion), but the platform's structure allows it to expand to many other types of algorithms (recursion, dynamic programming, optimization). 

Makes use of React, NodeJS, Docker, Flask, PostgreSQL, Apache, Python, JavaScript, and HTML.
